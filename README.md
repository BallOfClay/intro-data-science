The goal of this brief course is to provide you with a fun introduction to the world of Data Science with Python.

#### Here's what we'll be doing:
* Overview of basic Python and programming concepts
* Building a simple application using Python
* Playing around and break things



## Setting up your computer


#### Please set up the following:

* A web browser to see what we're working on as others see it (Recommend Google Chrome: [chrome.google.com] (http://chrome.google.com))

* We're going to use [Google Colab](colab.research.google.com) so you will need a Google account if you want to save your own copy.

Well... that was easy!
