## Overview
The goal of this brief course is to provide you with a fun introduction to the world of Data Science with Python.

#### Here's what we'll be doing:
* Overview of basic Python and programming concepts
* Building a simple application using Python
* Playing around and break things



## Setting up your computer


#### Please set up the following:

* A web browser to see what we're working on as others see it (Recommend Google Chrome: [chrome.google.com] (http://chrome.google.com))
* We will be using an online text editor for this workshop. You can sign up here: [https://repl.it/](https://repl.it/)


Well... that was easy! 


## What this workshop is

A super friendly introduction to Python No previous experience expected! 

You can't learn EVERYTHING in ~2 hours. But you can learn enough to get excited and comfortable to keep working and learning on your own! 

- This course is for absolute beginners
- Ask Questions!
- Answer Questions!
- Help others when you can
- Its ok to get stuck, just ask for help!
- Feel free to move ahead
- Be patient and nice

### Challenges:
Get the most out of this workshop! We'll occasionally do a "CHALLENGE" where I give you an exercise to do in several minutes. It can be even more effective to partner up with someone next to you, but you can work on your own if you want. No pressure to solve the challenge. I'll share how I would solve it after the time is up.

## What is Data Science?

Gear question!


### Who uses Python?


### What can you do with Python


#### Popular Frameworks and libraries to keep in mind


- Data Science
	- Matplot Lib
	- Tensorflow
	- Keras
	- Numpy
	- Pandas
	- Scikit Learn
	- OpenCV


*Note*: if you're thinking of exploring data science with python look into using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to manage your python and data libraries

Also [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true) is a awesome place to start as well without having to install anything!
